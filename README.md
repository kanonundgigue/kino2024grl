All data (except for Antarctica_LGM_Proxies.csv) resulted from an isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation model named "iso-MIROC5" (Okazaki and Yoshimura, 2019, JGR).
Antarctica_LGM_Proxies.csv resulted from Table 1 of Werner et al. (2018, Nat. Com.) and Steig et al. (2020, USAP-DC).
The definition of southward moisture fluxes proposed by Newman et al. (2012, JC) was adopted.
The module of ESMValTool (Righi et al., 2020, GMD) was customized to calculate Eady growth rate.
Scripts used in Kino et al. (2024, GRL) are available in a GitHub repository.
